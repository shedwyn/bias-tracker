# Bias-Tracker Purpose and Function

*see general_notes folder and open Proposal_formal.md for full proposal*


It is easier to speak of this in terms of the goal behind the product.  Simply, this program is being developed to give the person who feels she is experiencing unconscious gender bias in an organizational setting a sense of control.  How?

* The user is able to record all incidents that appear as if they *could* be unconscious (or, of course, conscious) gender bias.  
* She can then see statistics for type of incidents she recorded (positive or negative)
* She can also see the statistics for type of incident(s) recorded for a specific incident Subject (or iSub) 
* She can also see statistics on the detailed descriptors for each type of incident (i.e. how many times she recorded an iSub "not listening")
* By recording the incidents, including positive, she can review with a cooler head later to see if there may be bias at work in her organization, if certain iSubs are either allies or challenges, and what specific things are happeningn to make her feel excluded or exhibit gender bias.  
* This all allows her to tailor responses ahead of time for future interactions, to get a feel for a particular organization's success at eliminating gender bias, give her data to take to organization leaders for discussion, etc.

* future planned features will include:
    * ability to see organization-wide data,
    * ability to see statistics for a specific individual be they they author or subject of an incident report
    * to record responses to incidents,
    * user feedback on responses,
    * points/rewards system for recording incidents, being part of a positive inclusive incident, and/or showing overall improvement as an individual
